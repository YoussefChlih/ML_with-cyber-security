# Phishing URL Detection Improved

In this notebook, we will explore an improved approach to detecting phishing URLs using machine learning. The notebook will guide you through the steps, including data collection from real sources, feature engineering, model training, API deployment, and monitoring.

## 1. Data Collection

We will collect phishing URL data from reliable sources such as the PhishTank database and other available datasets.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example code for data collection
url_data = pd.read_csv("path_to_phishing_data.csv")
print(url_data.head())
```

## 2. Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, we need to clean and preprocess the data.

```python
# Cleaning the data
url_data.dropna(inplace=True)  # Drop missing values
url_data['label'] = url_data['label'].map({'phishing': 1, 'legitimate': 0})  # Encoding labels
```

## 3. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is crucial for improving model performance. We will create features based on the URL structure.

```python
def extract_features(url):
    # Function to extract features from the URL
    features = {}
    features['length'] = len(url)
    features['is_ip'] = int(bool(re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+', url)))  # Check for IP address in URL
    # Add more features as needed
    return features

features = url_data['url'].apply(extract_features).apply(pd.Series)
```

## 4. Model Training

We will train a machine learning model using the processed features.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X = features
y = url_data['label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Model Evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

## 5. API Deployment

To make our model accessible, we will deploy it as an API using Flask.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    url = request.json['url']
    features = extract_features(url)
    prediction = model.predict([features])
    return jsonify({'prediction': 'phishing' if prediction[0] == 1 else 'legitimate'})
```

## 6. Monitoring

After deployment, we need to monitor the model's performance continuously.

```python
# Code for monitoring the predictions and performance over time
```

## Conclusion

In this notebook, we have walked through the entire machine learning pipeline for phishing URL detection. Continuous monitoring and updating the model with new data is essential for maintaining its effectiveness.
